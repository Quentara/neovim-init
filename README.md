# 💾 Neovim Init File

Welcome! Feel free to use my personal init.vim file for Neovim. It is optimized for writing Ruby and working with Ruby on Rails.

The Init File includes:
- Nerdtree
- The awesome Horizon Theme
- The Ruby and Rails Plugins `vim-ruby` and `vim-rails`
- `vim-commentary` to toggle comments
- Multi-cursors with `vim-visual-multi`
- Emmet for quickly creating blocks of html (trigger key is `,`)

Have an awesome day and stay healthy! 🙏
Dan
